# Netflix Clone

Hi everyone! This is my take on creating a netflix clone. It's built solely with React using APIs from The Movie Database and its styled with CSS and HTML. Enjoy!

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I'm looking to deploy it soon on Netlify or Firebase.
